# Credential Registry

The Credential Registry of verifiable credentials about entities. A public instance of a Credential Registry, such as [BC's OrgBook](https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca) contains a verifiable credentials about organizations (incorporations, professionals, etc.) issued by trusted public services such as Corporate Registries, regulatory agencies, permitting services, licencing services, procurement services and the like.

The Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) envisions the possibility of a number of public repositories of Verifiable Claims as a way of bootstrapping a trusted digital ecosystem.

`The Credential Registry` is being developed as part of the Verifiable Organizations Network (VON). For more information on VON see https://vonx.io.  Even, better - join in with what we are doing and contribute to VON and the Indy community.

## Quick Start Guide

The best way to get started with a new project is by working with a running instance.  The VON [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/bcgov/greenlight/blob/master/docker/VONQuickStartGuide.md) will get you started with an [Indy Network](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network), an instance of [TheOrgBook (this repo)](https://github.com/bcgov/TheOrgBook) and an instance of [GreenLight](https://github.com/bcgov/greenlight) running on your local machine in Docker.  Give it a try!

## Running the Credential Registry on OpenShift
